"""
This package now holds the ttide_py API.

The included functions are:

t_tide : The t_tide harmonic analysis function.

t_predic : The t_tide harmonic fit function.

TTideCon : The t_tide constituents class (returned by t_tide).





A direct conversion of T_Tide to Python.

This is a work in progress. It is not done.

It is now mostly functional.
Any help with finishing the conversion is welcome.

Credit for T\_Tide goes to Rich Pawlowicz, the original creator of T\_Tide. 
It is available at http://www2.ocgy.ubc.ca/~rich/.

A description of the theoretical basis of the analysis and some
implementation details of the Matlab version can be found in:

    "Harmonic Analysis Including Error Estimates in MATLAB
    using T_TIDE", Computers and Geosciences, 28, 929-937 (2002).

Citation of this article would be appreciated if you find the toolbox
useful (either the Matlab version, or this Python one).
