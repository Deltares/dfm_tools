INSTALL GITHUB:
Download git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
install with default settings
open command line in a folder where you want to clone the dfm_tools github repo, eg C:\DATA\GitHub
git clone https://github.com/openearth/dfm_tools.git
(repos gets cloned to local drive, checkout of master branch)

INSTALL PYTHON:
Download the newest anaconda 64 bit
install, including PATH checkbox

OPTIONAL: CREATE SEPARATE PYTHON ENVIRONMENT:
open command line
>> conda create -n github_env python=3.7 spyder-kernels=0.* ipykernel
(spyder-kernel=0.* is for spyder 3, for spyder 4 you should leave the version out)
>> conda activate github_env
	python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
	(the resulting path you need some steps later)
>> conda deactivate
open spyder from start menu or anaconda or anything
Go to Tools >> Preferences >> Python interpreter >> point to github_env python.exe (print of sys.executable)
restart IPython console

LINK GITHUB CLONE VIA PIP:
open command window
navigate to github clone folder
optional: >> activate github_env
>> python -m pip install -e dfm_tools
(pip developer mode, any updates to folder by github will be available)
(also install all packages in requirements.txt)

USE IT IN YOUR SCRIPTS:
import dflowutil
import dfm_tools
dflowutil.BalanceFile('test.txt')
(latter is still empty)

COMMITTING EDITS TO GITHUB:
open GIT bash window
navigate to local dfm_tools folder (not to folder above, then git does not work)
git config --global user.email [emailaddress]
git config --global user.name [username]
CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH:
1:
	manually create a branch on website
	git remote update origin --prune
	(update local branch list)
	git checkout branchname
	(checkout branch)
2:
	git checkout --branch branchname
	(create new branch and checkout, combination of git branch and git checkout commands)
REALLY COMMIT AND PUSH:
Optional: git pull origin master
(gets edits from master to current local branch, might induce conflicts)
git add .
git commit -m "message to be included with your commit"
git push origin branchname
DO NOT: git push origin master
(local changes are now also visible under branchname on github, there you can request merging with master)

NOTES
>> conda activate github_env
	python
		exit()
	ipython
		exit
	conda deactivate	
>> conda info --envs
>> conda remove -n github_env --all
