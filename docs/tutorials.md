#Introduction

There are a few tutorials available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/blob/main/docs/notebooks) which are embedded on the following pages. You can use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Deltares/dfm_tools/HEAD?urlpath=/tree/docs/notebooks) to run these notebooks interactively (loading can take a while).

There are also [example scripts](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/tree/main/tests/examples) available with more specific applications.

More inspiration in the [pdf](https://nbviewer.org/github/Deltares/dfm_tools/raw/pptx/docs/dfm_tools.pdf?flush_cache=true) with dfm_tools information, features and examples

dfm_tools uses xarray in many of its functions. If you are unfamiliar with it, please read the [xarray tutorial](https://tutorial.xarray.dev/overview/xarray-in-45-min.html). When processing FM mapoutput xugrid is used, which is a wrapper on top of xarray that supports ugrid topology. Please read the [xugrid user guide](https://deltares.github.io/xugrid/user_guide.html) if you want to know more.
