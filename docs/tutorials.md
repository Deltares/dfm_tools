#Introduction

There are a few tutorials available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/blob/main/docs/notebooks) which are embedded on the following pages. You can [use binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Deltares/dfm_tools/HEAD) to run these notebooks interactively (loading takes a while).

There are also [example scripts](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/tree/main/tests/examples) available with more specific applications.

More inspiration in the [pdf](https://nbviewer.org/github/Deltares/dfm_tools/raw/pptx/docs/dfm_tools.pdf?flush_cache=true) with dfm_tools information, features and examples
