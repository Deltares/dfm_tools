- interpolation of regularly gridded dataset (CMEMS, HYCOM etc) to plipoints with `interp_regularnc_to_plipoints()` by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer)
- interpolation of regularly gridded tide datasets to plipoints with `interpolate_tide_to_bc()` by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer) in [#288](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/pull/288)
