## 0.11.0 (2023-04-24)

Replaced large parts of the code with [HYDROLIB-core](https://github.com/Deltares/hydrolib-core), [xugrid](https://github.com/Deltares/xugrid) and [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray). This means a non-backwards compatible change in the API but improved experience. xugrid gives loads of new features like coordinate conversion, shapefile export, cropping a unstructured dataset, regridding, rasterizing.

### Feat

- renaming water quality variables in dataset with `rename_waqvars()` by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer) in [#259](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/pull/259), this deprecates `get_varnamefromattrs()`
- renaming variables in fourier dataset with `rename_fouvars()` by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer) in [#283](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/pull/283)
- simplified background plotting with contextily and cartopy by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer) in [#328](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/pull/328), this deprecates `plot_background()`
- create release and pypi/pip installable by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer) in [#338](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/pull/338)
- using [HYDROLIB-core](https://github.com/Deltares/hydrolib-core) for reading/writing of D-FlowFM files, this deprecates `write_bcfile()`, `read_bcfile()`, `Polygon()`, `write_timfile()` and `read_timfile()`
- interpolation of regularly gridded dataset (CMEMS, HYCOM etc) to plipoints with `interp_regularnc_to_plipoints()` by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer)
- interpolation of regularly gridded tide datasets to plipoints with `interpolate_tide_to_bc()` by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer) in [#288](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/pull/288)

### Fix

- made bedlevel variable optional in `get_Dataset_atdepths()`, if not explicitly needing it by [@veenstrajelmer](https://github.com/veenstrajelmer) in [#241](https://github.com/Deltares/dfm_tools/pull/241)
